# NetDiff-A-Service-Guided-Hierarchical-Diffusion-Model-for-Network-Flow-Trace-Generation
NetDiff uses a hierarchical generation structure to model mobile users' interactions with network services, like app usage traces. It leverages these traces to guide network flow generation, avoiding pattern collapse by gradually eliminating noise and using service conditions for precise control at each generation step.

### Step 1ï¼š APP Usage Generation

python NetDiff_LDM.py

### Step 2:  Get the embedding of generated APP Usage

python NetDiff_embedding.py

### Step 3: Network Flow Traces Generation

python main.py
